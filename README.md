Dev Footprint (currently in Beta), is a single-page-application that allows developers currently in the job market to display an aggregated snapshot of useful data from their GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Resume. This provides potential employers with an easy-to-view display of data which is normally accessed separately. Github commit history and tweets are pulled live and resumes can be downloaded via the displayed image (linked to Scribd).
